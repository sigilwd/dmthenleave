    <h1>Don't DM and Disappear, Stay Engaged</h1>
    <p>
      Every now and then, in online communities, someone sends a direct message (DM) with a question or issue. But when you take the time to respond, they vanish without a trace. It often starts like this:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Folix:</span>
      <p class="message">
        Hey, can you help me with [problem]?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      You respond, offering help or asking for more details, but instead of a follow-up, there's silence:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">You:</span>
      <p class="message">
        Sure, I can help! Could you explain a bit more about the issue you're facing?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And then... nothing. No response, no clarification, just an empty chat window.
    </p>
    <p>
      This kind of behavior can be frustrating for several reasons. When you DM someone for help, you're asking them to spend their time and energy on your problem. If you don't engage in the conversation, you're wasting that effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, not responding can lead to missed opportunities. The person you're messaging might have valuable advice or solutions, but if you don't keep the conversation going, you'll never know.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, if you reach out to someone with a question or request, make sure to follow up. Stay engaged in the conversation, provide the information they need, and thank them for their time. Itâ€™s a simple courtesy that makes a big difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      To summarize: Don't DM and disappear. If you ask for help, be present, and keep the conversation alive until the problem is resolved.
